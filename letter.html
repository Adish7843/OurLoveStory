                <p>Adeena, i am writing this to tell you that i love you so much.You are my first thought in the morning and i hold you in my last breath in the evening. I need you more and more each day like an addiction of some sort an addiction to love you more and more each day i guess you fixed me when i broke and you took my pain away you listened when i cried and you stood right there when i laughed but most importantly you never let me go-No matter how hard i tried at first to not fall in love and push you away sometimes but you still stayed and that is something i will never be able to forget and- when i say i love you more i dont just mean i love you more than you love me I mean i love you more than the bad days ahead of us i love you more than any fight we will ever have i love you more than the distance between us i love you more than anything that would try and come between us I LOVE YOU THE MOST ADEENA</p>
